  "description": "Functional programming is a programming paradigm, that is another, different than OOP, way of thinking about how to build the application. The main unit of functional programming is a function. We already use functions on daily basis so what is the difference in this case? To use FP we have to think differently, the aim is to abstract control flows and operations on data with functions, so by doing that we could avoid side effects and reduce mutation of state.",
