  "description": "Finishing theme of this lecture will be about graphs. All types of trees we looked at in this lecture are special cases of graphs. A graph is a data structure, that consists of finite set of vertices, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. These pairs are known as edges.",
